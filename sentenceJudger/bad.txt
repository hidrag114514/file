His laziness and lack of ambition are holding him back.The service at the restaurant was abysmal; we waited over an hour for our food.The project was a complete disaster due to poor planning and miscommunication.She can be quite arrogant and dismissive towards others.The company's decision to cut corners resulted in a subpar product.His constant complaining and negativity are exhausting to be around.The movie was a total flop; critics panned it for its lackluster plot.I was disappointed by his insincerity and lack of integrity.The customer service was appalling; they were rude and unhelpful.The atmosphere at the party was tense and uncomfortable due to unresolved conflicts.Stop complaining!You make me sick!What's wrong with you? You shouldn't have done that!You're a jerk!Don't talk to me like that!Who do you think you are?What's your problem?I hate you!
